        \item {The research was conducted for AICTC 2016Â Proceedings of the International Conference on Advances in Information Communication Technology and Computing under the theme of Ad-hoc Networks.The researched carried out was a proposal for an Efficient Power Aware Ad-hoc on-Demand Distance Vector(EPAAODV) protocol. This is a modification of the normal functioning of the Ad-hoc on-Demand Distance Vector protocol. The proposed technique made an attempt to increase network lifetime of a MANET. An energy consumption analysis was performed on the proposed work and the existing protocol. Other parameters such as, packet delivery ratio (PDR) and throughput
        were also analyzed using network simulator (NS2).}
